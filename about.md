The main idea of this blog is to provide knowledge of hacking techniques and penetration testing, for this all the tutorials will be lessons that can be learned with the HackTheBox machines.  
For reasons of regulation, only thematic ones will be found in relation to machines that are already removed.

If you want to read more content created by me,  I invite you to my personal blog where I explain different topics of computer security:
